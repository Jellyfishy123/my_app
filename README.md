## New Flutter App: ##
The application generates cool-sounding names, such as "newstay", "lightstream", "mainbrake", or "graypine". The user can ask for the next name, favorite the current one, and review the list of favorited names on a separate page. The app is responsive to different screen sizes. <br>

My first project in Flutter is based off https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#0 <br>
This is in preparation for SC2006 Software Engineering in Y2S2.
